# note-taker

## Approach 

The focus of building this note-taking app was to demonstrate our knowledge of node.js and our ability to build a databse that would be able to house all of the info taken from the front end and be able to post it to the back end and get that information when it was called for. To do this we had to build api and html routes to ensure info was being sent to the right place. These routes were built in the server.js file.

## Installation

To install this repo on your local drive you would have to clone the ssh key from my repo. Head into your local drive of choice in terminal or bash and do a git clone. Once you have done a git clone you are free to start working on this project. If you want to push your changes to my repo then you would have to head into terminal/bash and do a git add . Then a git commit -m explaning the changes made, and finally a git push to push the files onto the repo. 

## Usage 

If you want to use this program, first do a git clone as previously described. Once you have the folder in your vs code then open the integrated terminal by right clicking on the server.js and running the command, node server.js . This will start the program running, follow the prompts and you will have a note taking app up and running.
